About Me
I'm a 22-year-old student from Uzbekistan with a deep passion for technology, coding, and AI. I specialize in Python development and work as a full-stack developer, using Python frameworks for both frontend and backend. Whether it’s building web applications with Django, Flask, or Streamlit, or creating desktop apps with PyQt, I create solutions that meet modern needs. When I’m not coding, you can find me diving into the world of anime or enjoying a cold beer.
